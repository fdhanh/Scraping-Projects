# INTRO
Actually this is a part of the previous market sentiment analysis projects, but I'll make it separately again.
I used to scraping from www.femaledaily.com which is the bigger one of web review about skincare, makeup, etc. So I want to got a product review from skincare category which is a nightcream for the sub-category.
The output table will contain: 
- Category
- Brand
- Product
- Price
- Username
- Skin condition & age
- Did the product recommend/not by user
- Post date
- Review
- Product rating by user

And the review was in Indonesia language
